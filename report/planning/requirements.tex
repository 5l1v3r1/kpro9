\label{chap:requirements}
This chapter describes an utility that creates Wireshark dissectors from C
header files. The dissectors must interpret binary representations of C
structs. In \autoref{sec:reqsoverview} we give a high level overview of the
utility and its requirements, \autoref{sec:usecases} provides use cases for the
utility, \autoref{sec:reqspriority} explains how we prioritizes the
requirements, \autoref{sec:reqscompl} explains how we estimate their
complexity, \autoref{sec:reqslist} lists all the functional and non-function
requirements, and \autoref{sec:prodbacklog} contains the complete product
backlog.

\section{Overview}
%-----------------
\label{sec:reqsoverview}
We are to create an utility that allows Wireshark to interpret the binary
representations of C-language structs. While C structs seldom are exchanged
across networks, they are sometimes used in inter-process communication. The
purpose of the utility described here is to provide Wireshark with the
capability of automatically dissecting the binary representation of a C struct,
as long as its definition is known.

The expected work flow for the utility is to read one or more C header files,
which contain struct definitions, and output Wireshark dissectors, implemented
in Lua scripts. A configuration file or source code annotations in the header
files may be used when additional configuration is required.

\subsection{List of requirements}
\autoref{tab:reqsoverview} is an overview of all the requirements. See
\autoref{tab:funcreq} and \autoref{tab:nonfuncreq} for more detailed
description of the requirements.

\section{Prioritization}
%-----------------------
\label{sec:reqspriority}
The team has, in cooperation with the customer, prioritized the requirements
in three categories:
\begin{inparaenum}[\itshape a\upshape)]
	\item High,
	\item Medium or
	\item Low.
\end{inparaenum} 

\begin{description}
	\item[High] Core functionality of the utility which must be implemented.
	\item[Medium] Requirements that will improve the value of the utility.
	\item[Low] Requirements that will not add much value to the utility.
\end{description}

\section{Complexity}
%-------------------
\label{sec:reqscompl}
The team has estimated the complexity for each requirement. We use the same
categories as for requirements priority:
\begin{inparaenum}[\itshape a\upshape)]
	\item High,
	\item Medium or
	\item Low.
\end{inparaenum} 

\begin{description}
	\item[High] Functionality which seems difficult and non-trivial to create.
	\item[Medium] Functionality that seems time consuming but straight forward.
	\item[Low] Requirements that are trivial to implement.
\end{description}

\section{Use Cases}
%------------------
\label{sec:usecases}

\subsection{Actors}
An actor specifies a role played by an external person or thing that interact
with our utility. We have three types of actors to consider. First is the
primary actor which in our case is the user of our utility. He who feeds it a
C file to generate dissectors. A secondary actor is someone who configures our
utility to change the output of it. Finally we have an offstage actor which
does not use our utility himself, but uses the output dissectors in Wireshark.

We have defined two use case actors for our utility. The customer has
specified that the user is the most important actor.
\begin{description}
	\item[Administrator] User of the generated Wireshark dissectors, offstage actor
	\item[Developer] User and configurer of utility, primary and secondary actor
\end{description}

\subsection{Use Cases}
This sections contains use case diagrams for the two actors, and detailed textual use cases for these diagrams.
