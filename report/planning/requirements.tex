\label{chap:req:requirements}
This chapter describes an \gls{utility} that creates \Gls{wireshark} \glspl{dissector} from \Gls{c}
\gls{header} files. The \glspl{dissector} must interpret \gls{binary} representations of \Gls{c}
\glspl{struct}. In \autoref{sec:req:list} we give a high level overview of the
\gls{utility} and lists all the functional and non-function requirements.

\hyperref[sec:req:stories]{Section \ref*{sec:req:stories}} gives user stories
for the requirements, while \autoref{sec:req:usecases} provides use cases for
the \gls{utility}, and \autoref{sec:prodbacklog} contains the complete product
backlog.

\section{List of requirements}
%-----------------------------
\label{sec:req:list}

\subsection{Overview}
%-----------------
We are to create an \gls{utility} that allows \Gls{wireshark} to interpret the \gls{binary}
representations of \Gls{c}-language \glspl{struct}. While \Gls{c} \glspl{struct} seldom are exchanged
across networks, they are sometimes used in \gls{ipc}. The
purpose of the \gls{utility} described here is to provide \Gls{wireshark} with the
capability of automatically dissecting the \gls{binary} representation of a \Gls{c} \gls{struct},
as long as its definition is known.

The expected work flow for the \gls{utility} is to read one or more \Gls{c} \gls{header} files,
which contain \gls{struct} definitions, and output \Gls{wireshark} \glspl{dissector}, implemented
in \Gls{lua} scripts. A configuration file or source code annotations in the \gls{header}
files may be used when additional configuration is required.

\autoref{tab:req:func} lists the functional requirements, while
\autoref{tab:req:nonfunc} lists the non-functional requirements. Each
requirement have a priority (Pri) and a complexity (Cmp): \Gls{h}, 
\Gls{m} or \Gls{l} which is explained in \autoref{sec:req:priority} and
\autoref{sec:req:compl}.

\subsection{Prioritization}
%--------------------------
\label{sec:req:priority}
The team has, in cooperation with the customer, prioritized the requirements
in three categories:
\begin{inparaenum}[\itshape a\upshape)]
	\item High,
	\item Medium or
	\item Low.
\end{inparaenum} 

\begin{description}
	\item[High] Core functionality of the \gls{utility} which must be implemented.
	\item[Medium] Requirements that will improve the value of the \gls{utility}.
	\item[Low] Requirements that will not add much value to the \gls{utility}.
\end{description}

\subsection{Complexity}
%----------------------
\label{sec:req:compl}
The team has estimated the complexity for each requirement. We use the same
categories as for requirements priority:
\begin{inparaenum}[\itshape a\upshape)]
	\item High,
	\item Medium or
	\item Low.
\end{inparaenum} 

\begin{description}
	\item[High] Functionality which seems difficult and non-trivial to create.
	\item[Medium] Functionality that seems time consuming but straight forward.
	\item[Low] Requirements that are trivial to implement.
\end{description}

	How & When the cparser module detects an \gls{enum} \gls{member} in a \gls{struct}, the cparser should search in an \gls{enum} dictionary and the \gls{enum} \gls{member} 
		will be mapped to the correct value found in the dictionary. A field representing the \gls{enum} will be added to the prototype object corresponding

	How & When the cparser module detects a \gls{struct} in the AST that is a \gls{member} of another \gls{struct}, the cparser searches for its definition in the

	What & The administrator wants the \gls{utility} to report an error if it discovers \glspl{struct} with the same name to avoid unforeseen name collisions. \\
	How & When the cparser module traverses the AST to look for \glspl{struct}, it will detect if there are \glspl{struct} with the same name by searching in a database 
		of all \glspl{struct} it has found so far. If a collision is detected the \gls{utility} will crash with an error message. \\
	Result & The \gls{utility} will detect duplicated name of \glspl{struct}. \\

	ID & US12 \\
	Requirement & FR2-B: The \gls{dissector} shall be able to support \glspl{struct} within \glspl{struct} \\
	What & The \gls{utility} should be able to create a \Gls{lua} \gls{dissector} that correctly
	displays \glspl{struct} within \glspl{struct} in \Gls{wireshark}. \\
	How & For each \gls{struct} definition encountered in cparser, a prototype object is created. This object will include an 	identifier number used to locate
		the \Gls{lua} \gls{dissector} for that \gls{struct}. When a \gls{struct} \gls{member} is located inside an outer \gls{struct}. The \gls{dissector} module encodes the identification number 
		and the size for the inner \gls{struct} into the \Gls{lua} \gls{dissector} for the outer \gls{struct}. The identification number is used to access the \gls{dissector} for the inner
		\gls{struct} when the outer \gls{struct} \gls{dissector} is used. The outer \gls{struct} \gls{dissector} uses the size of the inner \gls{struct} to know how much of the network package
		to forward to the inner \gls{struct} \gls{dissector}. The size and identification number of the inner \gls{struct} will be available in the \gls{struct} field corresponding to
		the inner \gls{struct} inside the \gls{protocol} object corresponding to the outer \gls{struct}.  \\
	Result & The \gls{dissector} module supports nested \glspl{struct} \\

	What & The administrator wants to specify integer \glspl{member}, represented by an enumerated named value, in a configuration file. \\
	How & The config module should read config files provided to the command line interface, and find any rules regarding enumerated integer values.
		The rules are used by the cparser when it translates 	\gls{struct} definitions to Protocol, and makes the cparser create EnumFields instead of normal
		Fields for the specified \glspl{member}. \\

	How & When the cparser module finds an \gls{array} declaration, it recursively traverses the tree until till it encounters the bottom of the declaration 
	to discover the size of the \gls{array}. The \gls{parser} module creates an instance of an \gls{array} field with the size and type of the \gls{array}. From the \gls{array} field
	the \gls{dissector} module generates a \gls{dissector} which has a sub tree for each level of the \gls{array}. \\

	will say how many \glspl{packet} of other \glspl{protocol} that follows the \gls{header}. In the config-file it is specified which \gls{member} contains this number, and what
 	type of \gls{protocol} the \gls{packet}(s) belong to. When the \gls{dissector} module generates a \gls{struct} containing a trailer, the correct \gls{dissector} for the trailer \gls{packet}(s)

	How & The administrator opens the user documentation and finds the section about configuration. From here he locates the sub section about trailers. 
	This section gives a good description of how to write such configuration for different types of trailers and provides sufficient examples, so that
	it is  clear to the administrator how to write the configuration he needs after reading the section. \\
	Result & The administrator is now able to utilise the trailer feature of CSjark. \\
	\midrule
	ID & US20 \\
	Requirements & FR4-B: Configuration must support custom \Gls{lua} files for specific \glspl{protocol} \\
	What & The administrator wants to specify custom \Gls{lua} files in the configuration, that are to be used in complex cases where our \gls{utility} is unable to generate
	a \gls{dissector} for the \Gls{c} \gls{header}. \\
	How & The config module should read config files provided to the command line interface, and find any rules regarding the use of custom \Gls{lua} files.
	When such a rule is found, the \gls{dissector} module will use the \Gls{lua} code found in the file(s) in addition to its own generated \Gls{lua} code.
	This is done by reading the custom \Gls{lua} file(s) and writing the content to the relevant parts of the \gls{dissector}. \\
	Result & The administrator can specify the use of custom \Gls{lua} file in the configuration. \\
	\midrule
	ID & US21 \\
	Requirements & FR4-C: Configuration must support custom handling of specific types. \\
	What & The administrator will be able to specify that a certain type should be handled in a specific way specified in a configuration file. This configuration must be
 	a \Gls{wireshark} supported lua field. The configuration could both be a global default value for that type, or specific for a \gls{struct} \gls{member}. \\
	How & The config module should read config files provided to the command line interface, and find any rules regarding the use of custom handling of types.
 	It will modify the field added to the prototype field representing the enclosing \gls{struct} with the behaviour specified in the configuration. \\
	Result & The administrator is able to configure custom behaviour for specific types. \\

	ID & US22 \\
	User doc & FR4-C: User documentation for configuring custom handling of specific types. \\
	What & The administrator should be able to find out how to specify custom handling for a specific type by reading the user documentation.\\
	How & The administrator opens the user documentation and finds the section about configuration. From here he locates the sub section about custom type handling. 
	This section gives a good description of how to write such configuration and what kind of configuration that could be done. There should also be some
 	examples to clarify the description. After reading the section, the administrator has a good idea of how to do the desired custom handling. \\
	Result & The administrator is able to use custom handling of specific types. \\

	ID & US23 \\
	Requirements &  FR4-D: Configuration must support specifying the ID of \glspl{dissector} \\
	What & The administrator wants to specify the ID of a \gls{dissector} in a configuration file. \\
	How & When the cparser finds a \gls{struct} in the \gls{AST} it looks for a configuration file for the \gls{struct}. If a config-file is found, the ID of the \gls{dissector}
	is mapped to the ID given in the config-file when generating the \gls{dissector}. \\	
	Result & The administrator can specfiy the ID of \glspl{dissector} in the configuration. \\

	What & The administrator wants the \gls{utility} to produce \glspl{dissector} that can be used on both little and big \gls{endian} platforms. \\
	How & The administrator will specify the platform he is using in a configuration file by adding a message flag and \gls{endian} pair. When the \gls{dissector} for a \gls{struct} is beeng generated,
 	the \gls{dissector} module in CSjark will encode a flag to \gls{endian} dictionary inside the \Gls{lua} \gls{dissector} file. This dictionary will be used to look up the \gls{endian} for a message given 
	its flag. If no \gls{endian} is found in the dictionary, it will use a default value. \\
	Result & The \glspl{dissector} are now able to support messages from platforms with different \gls{endian}. \\

	ID & US25 \\
	Requirements & FR6-C: Command line shall support batch processing of \Gls{c} \gls{header} and configuration files \\
	What & The administrator wants to set up the program to run automatically, so that the program creates \glspl{dissector} from the \Gls{c} \gls{header} and configuration file(s) that are specified. \\
	How & When the administrator feeds the command line with an input argument, \gls{header} or configuration, the \gls{utility} shall check if the input is a single file or a directory (folder). 
	If it is a file, parse it. If it is a folder, retrieve all files in that folder and add them to a list, this list will be sent to the \gls{parser} and all the files will be parsed one after another.
	A directory within a directory should be detected, and traversed recursively. With this approach we can start in a root folder and include all files,
 	independent of the depth. The \gls{batch mode} shall only include files with the extension .h (a \gls{header} file) or .yml (config file), which are the files that are going to be
	parsed as input.   \\
	Result & The administrator can feed the \gls{utility} with folders to make \glspl{dissector} of all the \glspl{header} found, also called \gls{batch mode}. \\

\subsection{Sprint 3}
\label{sec:req:stories3}
This section lists the user stories for the third sprint, these are displayed in \autoref{tab:req:stories7}, \autoref{tab:req:stories8} and \autoref{tab:req:stories9}.
As we are developing a very technical \gls{utility} we have written user stories with an implementation level of abstraction. 
These user stories represent how we intend to add the functionality of each requirement to the \gls{utility}.
The administrator in this context is the administrator at Thales Norway AS. 
The developer is the person that uses \Gls{wireshark} with the \gls{dissector} generated by CSjark.
This section is subject to change throughout the sprint, as we do not know all the details yet.

	What & The administrator wants to generate \glspl{dissector} which contain \glspl{struct} with unions as \glspl{member}. \\
	How & When the administrator feeds the \gls{utility} with a \gls{header} containing a \gls{union}, the cparser module should parse the \gls{union} and its \glspl{member} to find the total size of the 
	\gls{union} (which equals the size of the largest \gls{member}), and then create an instance of UnionField from the \gls{dissector} module representing the \gls{union} and its \gls{member}\\
	Result & The \gls{utility} support \gls{union} \glspl{member} in \glspl{struct}. \\
	\midrule
	ID & US27 \\
	Requirements & FR2-A\textit{Addition:} Display a \gls{wildcard} type for valid \Gls{c} types that \Gls{wireshark} has no support for. \\
	What & The administrator should be able to give the tool a \gls{struct} with a valid \Gls{c}-type even if \Gls{wireshark} does not have a way to display that type in a natural way.
	The \gls{dissector} should the just display the name of the type, the name of the \gls{member} and the hex value from the \gls{packet}. \\
	How & The \gls{parser} module will recognise if a type it encounters are supported in \Gls{wireshark} or not. If it is not supported, it will add a \gls{wildcard} field to the prototype object
	representing the enclosing \gls{struct}. \\
	Result & The administrator will be able to both run the \gls{utility} and get some information from the \gls{dissector} even if the type used is not supported by \Gls{wireshark}. \\
	\midrule
	ID & US28 \\
	Requirements & FR2-C: Filter and search on attributes (important to have descriptive abbreviations) \\
	What & The developer wants to find specific attributes in \Gls{wireshark}. The amount of data captured can be big.
	After the \glspl{packet} have been dissected, they are presented in \Gls{wireshark}. The developer will have a hard time finding 
	attributes by manual seeking. The built-in search and filter functionality needs to be supported to accommodate the developer. \\
	How & The functionality is already in \Gls{wireshark}. To utilize it, an abbreviation field must be provided to \Gls{wireshark}. This abbreviation field will be in the \gls{dissector} module
	and is included in the \gls{dissector} generated by the \gls{utility}. When \Gls{wireshark} runs the \gls{dissector}, all abbreviations are collected which will make it possible to filter and search
	on attributes. \\
	Result & The developer will be able to search and filter by attributes. \\
	\midrule
	ID & US29 \\
	Requirements & FR5-A: Flags must be specified in configuration for each platform \\
	What & The administrator wants to generate \glspl{dissector} which are different depending on platform. \\
	How & To be able to create \glspl{dissector} which are different depending on the originating platform, the administrator needs to specify in the configuration which platforms he wants to support.
	The config module should accept such configuration and store it so other modules can use it. \\ 
	Result & The administrator can specify what platform he is using by setting a flag in the configuration. \\

	How & When the administrator feeds the \gls{utility} a \gls{header} file and a config file with a set of platform he wants \glspl{dissector} for, the config module will create new \gls{header} files
	with \Gls{c} \gls{preprocessor} directives for each platform. These files should define platform-specific macros which emulates parsing on the specific platform. 
	The \gls{dissector} module then create different \glspl{dissector} for each message on each platform, and a mapping is added inside the master \Gls{lua} file which maps message id and

	How & The administrator specify the macro associated with a platform together with the platform definition configuration. The \gls{utility} then make an auxiliary \gls{header} file for each 
	platform configuration with the specified macro definition. These \glspl{header} are forwarded to the \gls{parser} module, which uses them to generate
  	one \gls{dissector} for each platform for each \gls{struct}. All \glspl{dissector} dissecting the same \glspl{struct} are stored in the same file, but are added to a platform specific \gls{dissector} table. \\

\section{Use Cases}
%------------------
\label{sec:req:usecases}
This sections contains use case diagrams for our two actors, and detailed
textual use cases for these diagrams.

\subsection{Actors}
%------------------
An actor specifies a role played by an external person or thing that interact
with our \gls{utility}. We have three types of actors to consider. First is the
primary actor which in our case is the user of our \gls{utility}. He who feeds it a
\Gls{c} file to generate \glspl{dissector}. A secondary actor is someone who configures our
\gls{utility} to change the output of it. Finally we have an offstage actor which
does not use our \gls{utility} himself, but uses the output \glspl{dissector} in \Gls{wireshark}.

We have defined two use case actors for our \gls{utility}. The customer has specified
that the offstage actor, called administrator, is the most important actor.
\begin{description}
	\item[Developer] User of the generated \Gls{wireshark} \glspl{dissector}, offstage actor
	\item[Administrator] User and configurer of \gls{utility}, primary and secondary actor
\end{description}
