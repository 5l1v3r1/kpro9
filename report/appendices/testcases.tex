\section{Sprint 4}
%----------------------
In this sprint we ran the testcases shown in \autoref{tab:TID26}-\ref{tab:TID48}. These are tests to see that the utility has been fixed in accordance to the  extra requirements made by the customer in sprint 3 as well as the final touches that were needed in order to get the utility to work in a real environment. This section also includes the testcases made for the non-functional requirements.
