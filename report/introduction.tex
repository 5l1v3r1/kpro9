This chapter will give a brief introduction to CSjark.

The first section will explain dissectors in detail, how Wireshark works and how dissectors are used in Wireshark.

The second section will describe how Lua code is built by our utility. 
The connection between Wireshark and the Lua structs protocol will also be explained.

The third, and last section gives an overview of the entire process of debugging a C struct, from the parsing of the struct definition, through the
generation of the dissector and to displaying it in dissected form in Wireshark.
