Installing CSjark
=================

Dependencies
------------

CSjark is written in Python 3.2, and therefore needs Python 3.2 (or later) to run. Latest implementation of Python can be downloaded from `Python website <http://www.python.org/>`_. For installing please follow the instruction found there.

There are three 3rd party dependencies to get CSjark working:

#. **PLY** (Python Lex-Yacc)

    :Required version: 
        3.4
    :Download location: 
        http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/
    :Notes: 
        PLY is an implementation of lex and yacc parsing tools for Python. It is required by pycparser. Instructions and further information can be found on the page linked above.

#. **pycpaser** <http://code.google.com/p/pycparser/>`_
    
    :Required version: latest development version from pycparser repository 
    :Download location: pycparser repository: http://code.google.com/p/pycparser/source/checkout
    :Notes: 
        Pycparser is a C parser (and AST generator) implemented in Python. Due to the continuous development, CSjark requires the latest development version (not the release version).

#. **C  preprocessor**
    CSjark requires a C-preprocessor. The way how to get one depends on operating system used by the user:
    :Windows: Bundled with CSjark.
    :OS X, Linux, Solaris: Needs to be installed separately. For example, as a part of `GCC <http://gcc.gnu.org/>`_

#. **pyYAML** 
    :Required version: 3.10
    :Download location: http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML
    :Notes: pyYAML is a YAML parser and emitter for the Python programming language. `YAML <http://yaml.org/>`_ is a standard used to specify configurations to CSjark. The website includes both a way to download the software and also instructions of how to install it.

#. **Wireshark**
    :Required version: 1.7 dev (build 39446 or newer)
    :Download location: http://www.wireshark.org/download/automated/, on the page, browse for the required platform version
    :Note: Wireshark is an open source protocol analyzer which can use the Lua dissectors generated by CSjark. To get the proper integration of Lua dissectors, the latest development version of Wireshark is required.
