Test identifier & TID01 Supporting parameters for c-header file\\[0.5ex]
Tester & Team member responsible for the test\\[0.5ex]
Prerequisites & The program has to have been compiled on the system\\[0.5ex]
Feature & Test that we are able to feed the solution with a c-header file and have it get dissected\\
Execution & 1.Start the program\newline
		2.Write the name of the c-header file in the command line\newline
		 3.Read the output given by the program\\ 
Expected result & 1.The program should start up without any errors and present the user with a command line interface\newline
3. The user should be presented with some text expressing the success of the LUA-file generation\\[0.5ex]

Tester & Team member responsible for the test\\[0.5ex]
Prerequisites & The program has to have been started\\[0.5ex]
Feature & Test that our utility will be able to make a dissectors for C-header files including the following basic data types: int, float, char and boolean \\
Execution & 1. Write the name of a c-header file which includes the aforementioned basic data types.\newline
		2. Read the output given by the program
