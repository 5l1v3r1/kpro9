\section{Wireshark}
Wireshark (previously Ethereal) is a free, open source network protocol analyzer. It lets you capture and browse traffic running through a computer network. Wireshark is currently being developed by the wireshark team, a group of networking experts spanning the globe. Because of its rich set of features and ease of use, Wireshark is often used as a de facto standard in many different industries and educational institutions. Wireshark is able to display and dissect and display data from a plenthora of different protocols, but one of its strengths lies in the ease of which developers can add their own dissectors, post-dissectors and taps. Developers can add their own dissectors either by using the programming language C or the LUA-scripting language. In general, most dissectors are written in C and compiled with wireshark as C is several times faster than LUA. LUA-scripts on the other hand are mostly used as prototypes or to process non time crucial data.
