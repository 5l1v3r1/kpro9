\section{Sprint Planning}
%------------------------
The fourth sprint will be the last iteration in this project. Testing and bugfixing will take most of the sprint work hours, because it is very important to make the utility work properly on Thales source code. Now the utility fail on most of the structs: Stig tried to generate dissectors for 580 structs, where only 4 of them succeeded. It is probably just small tweaks needed, in order to make it work. 

\subsection{Duration}
%-----------------------
The sprint started with the planning meeting the 2nd of November and our work started the following day. The sprint duration is 14 days, and will end the 15th of November with a review meeting. 


\subsection{Sprint Goal}
%-----------------------
For the third sprint the team will update CSjark to version 0.3 which will extend the \gls{utility} so that it contains the complete functionality requested by the customer at this phase of the project. In this sprint we will pick all of the current requirements from the product backlog as all of the underlying functionality needed for them are already in place from the previous sprints. This means that we will also aim to create a draft of the final design of the system during the sprint.

The most important function that is going to be implemented in this sprint is being able to display packets from different originating platforms properly. This will be implemented by having every \gls{packet} contain a flag specifying their originating platform, and by having our \glspl{dissector} use this flag value to influence how it handles the data in the \gls{packet}.
