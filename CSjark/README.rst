CSjark: Tool for generating Lua dissectors
==========================================

Summary
-------
CSjark is a tool for generating Lua dissectors from C struct definitions
to use with Wireshark. Wireshark is a leading tool for capturing and
analysing network traffic. The goal with the dissectors is to make
Wireshark able to nicely display the values of a struct sent over the
network, along with member names and type. This can be a powerful tool
for debugging C programs that communicates with strucs over the network.
