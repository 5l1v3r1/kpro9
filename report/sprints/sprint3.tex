\subsection{Sprint Goal}
%-----------------------
For the third sprint the team will update CSjark to version 0.3 which will extend the utility so that it contains the complete functionality requested by the customer at this phase of the project. In this sprint we will pick all of the current requirements from the product backlog as all of the underlying functionality needed for them are already in place from the previous sprints. This means that we will also aim to create a draft of the final design of the system during the sprint.

The most important function that is going to be implemented in this sprint is being able to display packets from different originating platforms properly. This will be implemented by having every packet contain a flag specifying a their originating platforms, and by having our dissectors use this flag value to influence how it handles the data in the packet.
