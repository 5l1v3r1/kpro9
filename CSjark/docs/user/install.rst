Dependencies
------------

CSjark is written in Python 3.2, and will therefore need Python 3.2 or later to run. This can be obtained from http://www.python.org/. Instructions for installation can also be found there.

CSjark also depends on pycparser, which is a C parser implemented in Python. Pycparser again depends on PLY, which is a lex/yacc implementation in Python. PLY can be obtained from http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/ and pycparser can be at http://code.google.com/p/pycparser/. Both sites contains instructions for installation and more information about their functionality.

Optimalization: To get the pycparser library to work faster, navigate to the folder that pycparser
