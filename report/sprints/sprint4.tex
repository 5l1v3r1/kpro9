%------------------------
\section{Sprint Planning}
%------------------------
The fourth sprint will be the last iteration in this project. Testing and bugfixing will take most of the sprint work hours, because it is very important to make the utility work properly on Thales source code. Now the utility fail on most of the structs: Stig tried to generate dissectors for 580 structs, where only 4 of them succeeded. It will probably just be some small tweaks needed, to make it work for most of the structs.

We know that some of our earlier implementation do not work as intended or is incomplete. The customer has given us feedback on the fulfilled requirements, and pointed out what needs to be improved. These are important work items of this sprint backlog MAKE REF.

There will not be another sprint after this one, so we can not postpone any work items. Because of this, we had to make some of the new requirements from the customer optional, and also telling the customer that we will probably not be able complete all their desires. This is all part of the process of requirement negotiation.

Last sprint we had too many tasks and too little time, but in the end we managed to cover almost everything. This sprint we plan to use close to 350 hours, but 

\subsection{Duration}
%-----------------------
The sprint started with the planning meeting the 2nd of November and our work started the following day. The sprint duration is 14 days, and will end the 15th of November with a review meeting. 


\subsection{Sprint Goal}
%-----------------------
For the fourth spirint, which will be the last sprint, the team will focus on fixing and implement function that the customer will need to use the utility on their source code. Before the sprint was started the customer has tested the latest version of the utility, and has given the team feedback what they want fixed and which features that needs to be added. They have also given the team some requirement that are optional. 

The goal will be to improve the utility so the customer can use it on their source code. If the team has time, some of the optional requirements will be implemented. The team have a agreement with the customer that there will be written a implementation description for the optional requirements, that the team do not have time to implement.

Since the deadline of the project is 24th of November, there will also be a focus on preparing a presentation and improve the report for a final delivery.
