Using the generated Lua files in Wireshark
==========================================

1. These are the steps needed to use a Lua dissector generated by CSjark with Wireshark.
2. Locate the Personal configuration and the Personal Plugins directories. To do this, start Wireshark and click on ``Help`` in the menubar and then on ``About wireshark``. This should bring up the about wireshark dialog. From there, navigate to the ``folders`` tab. Locate Personal configuration  Personal Plugins and and note the folder paths. On a \*nixbased system this may be  ~/.wireshark/ and  ~/.wireshark/plugins/ and on Windows it may be C:\Users\*YourUserName*\AppData\Roaming\Wireshark\ and C:\Users\*YourUserName*\AppData\Roaming\Wireshark\plugins\
3. Copy the ``1-luastructs.lua`` into the Personal configuration directory located in the previous step. 
4. Copy your generated lua dissector to the Personal Plugins folder located in the first step.
5. This should probably be looked at!!!!! Open the ``init.lua`` file that should be in the Personal configuration directory (make one if it does not exists). Insert the following code: dofile(``1-luastructs.lua``) . This ensures that the 1-luastructs.lua is loaded before the lua scripts in the Personal Plugins folder.
6. Restart Wireshark.
#. To check that the scrips are loaded, click on the ``Help`` button in the menubar and choose ``About``. Navigate to the ``Plugins`` tab. The scripts should now appear in the list.



To add further dissectors, only step 2 and 5 needs to be repeated.
