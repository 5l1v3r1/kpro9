\chapter{Test Plan}
%==================
This chapter presents the test plan for our solution. The test plan is based on
the standards set by the IEEE829-1998 standard for software testing, but with a
few changes to better fit with our project. The purpose of this plan is to have
a structured way of preforming tests, as well as providing the developers with
a list of specific component-behaviors.The tests will be based on functional as
well as non functional requirements, deterring architectural drift and
enforcing our design plans for the system.

\section{Methods for testing}
%--------------------------------
When it comes to software testing, we have 2 different types of tests available, namely Black box and white box tests. This section is dedicated to the discussion of these 2 testing methodologies.

\section{White box testing}
%----------------------------
White box testing is a method of software testing where you test internal structures or modules of an application, as opposed to its functions. White box testing requires the tester to have an internal perspective of the system, as well as sufficent programming skills. As the utility was required to be able to function with a lot of different input, as well as being used as a debugging tool itself, we chose to have every developer on the team write unit tests for their own code, and then have someone else on the team do the testing of their code in order to ensure correctness.

\section{Black box testing}
%----------------------------
Black box testing is a method of software testing where you test the functionality of a system, as opposed to its internal structures. Black box testing does in general not require the tester to have any intimate knowledge about the system or any of the programming logic that went into making it. Black box test cases are built around the specifications and requirements of a system, i.e its functional and in some cases non-functional requirements. The team decided to use black box testing for both the functional and non-functional requirements of the utility, as the customer had already expressed thoughts on extending and understanding the non-functional parts of utility themselves. 


\section{Templates for testing}
%------------------------------
\autoref{tab:testcase} and \autoref{tab:testreport} are templates we'll be
using for testing purposes.

\begin{table}[ht] \small \center
\caption{Test case template \label{tab:testcase}}
\begin{tabular}{l l}
	\toprule
	Portion & Description \\
	\midrule
	Description & Description of requirement \\
	Tester & Team member responsible for the test \\
	Prerequisites & Conditions that needs to be fulfilled before starting the test \\
	Feature & Feature to test \\
	Execution & Steps to be executed in the test \\
	\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

\begin{table}[ht] \small \center
\caption{Test report template \label{tab:testreport}}
\begin{tabular}{l l}
	\toprule
	Portion & Description \\
	\midrule
	Description & Description of requirement \\
	Tester & Team member responsible for the test \\
	Date & The date the testing took place \\
	Result & Success \\
