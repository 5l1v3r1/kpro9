Welcome to CSjark's documentation!
==================================

CSjark is a tool for generating Lua dissectors from C struct definitions to use with Wireshark. Wireshark is a leading tool for capturing and analysing network traffic. The goal with the dissectors is to make Wireshark able to nicely display the values of a struct sent over the network, along with member names and type. This can be a powerful tool for debugging C programs that communicates with strucs over the network.

For more information about Wireshark please visit `Wireshark website <http://www.wireshark.org>`_.
