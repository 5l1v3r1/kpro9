\chapter{Test Plan}

This chapter presents the test plan for our solution. The test plan is based on  the standards set by the IEEE829-1998 standard for software testing, but with a few changes to better fit with our project. The purpose of this plan is to have a structured way of preforming tests, as well as providing the developers with a list of specific component-behaviours, based on the functional requirements. This will assist the developers working on the different components by giving them a list of objectives that should be solved during development of the different components.
