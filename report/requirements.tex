\label{chap:requirements}
This chapter describes an utility that creates Wireshark dissectors from C
header files. The dissectors must interpret binary representations of C
structs. In \autoref{sec:reqsoverview} we give a high level overview of the
utility and its requirements, \autoref{sec:usecases} provides use cases for the
utility, \autoref{sec:reqspriority} explains how we prioritizes the
requirements and \autoref{sec:reqslist} lists all the functional and
non-function requirements and their priority. Since this project follows Scrum,
each sprint chapter contains its own backlog.

\section{Overview}
%-----------------
\label{sec:reqsoverview}
We are to create an utility that allows Wireshark to interpret the binary
representations of C-language structs. While C structs seldom are exchanged
across networks, they are sometimes used in inter-process communication. The
purpose of the utility described here is to provide Wireshark with the
capability of automatically dissecting the binary representation of a C struct,
as long as its definition is known.

The expected work flow for the utility is to read one or more C header files,
which contain struct definitions, and output Wireshark dissectors, implemented
in Lua scripts. A configuration file or source code annotations in the header
files may be used when additional configuration is required.

\subsection{List of requirements}
See \autoref{tab:funcreq} and \autoref{tab:nonfuncreq} for more detailed
description of the requirements.

\begin{description}
    \item[FR01] Read C structs and generate Wireshark dissectors
\end{description}

\section{Use Cases}
%------------------
\label{sec:usecases}

\subsection{Actors}
An actor specifies a role played by an external person or thing that interact
with our utility. We have three types of actors to consider. First is the
primary actor which in our case is the user of our utility. He who feeds it a
C file to generate dissectors. A secondary actor is someone who configures our
utility to change the output of it. Finally we have an offstage actor which
does not use our utility himself, but uses the output dissectors in Wireshark.

\begin{description}
	\item[User] Primary actor - The user of our utility.
	\item[Configurer] Secondary actor - Configures the output of our utility.
	\item[Dissector] Offstage actor - User of Wireshark dissectors.
\end{description}

\subsection{Use Case Diagrams}
TODO!! Desperately need help for this....

\section{Prioritization}
%-----------------------
\label{sec:reqspriority}
The team has prioritized the requirements in three categories:
\begin{inparaenum}[\itshape a\upshape)]
	\item High,
	\item Medium or
	\item Low.
\end{inparaenum} 

\begin{description}
	\item[High] Core functionality of the utility which must be implemented.
	\item[Medium] Requirements that will improve the value of the utility.
	\item[Low] Requirements that will not add much value to the utility.
\end{description}

\section{List of requirements}
%-----------------------------
\label{sec:reqslist}
\autoref{tab:funcreq} lists the functional requirements, while
\autoref{tab:nonfuncreq} lists the non-functional requirements. Each
requirement have a priority (Pri) and a complexity (Cmp): High (H), 
Medium (M) or Low (L).
