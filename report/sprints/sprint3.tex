\section{Sprint Planning}
%------------------------
For the third sprint we intend to implement the remanding requirements in the product backlog. We feel that the first and second sprint has resulted in a satisfying utility, but it is still missing important functionality.

After two sprint iterations, we are still trying to improve our approach to Scrum. Each sprint results in new ideas and better ways to do the process, and in this sprint we want everything to be correct and in the right order.\\
\\
There will be two major changes this sprint:
\begin {itemize}
\item We will have a complete planning meeting. The meeting should result in a good planning document, user stories for all the requirements, complete set of work items in the sprint backlog and a early understanding of the design.  

\item In the sprint backlog we will have work items for every task that needs to be done throughout the sprint, including writing minutes, doing documentation, implementation and so on.  Assignment of responsibilities for items in the backlog should not be done at the planning meeting, we rather only give responsibility for one item for each team member at a time. The rest of the items will be unassigned. At each stand-up meeting we pick a task and must be done before the next meeting. This will ensure efficiency and the work done by others are easier to check and revise. It will give us a better work balance, as no team member can gap over to many tasks and leave none for the others.
\end{itemize}
We think that these changes will improve our work efficiency, and make sprint 3 the best one so far.


\subsection{Duration}
%-----------------------

The sprint started with the planning meeting the 19th of October and our work started the following day. The sprint duration is 14 days, and will end the 1st of November with a review meeting. 


\subsection{Sprint Goal}
%-----------------------
For the third sprint the team will update CSjark to version 0.3 which will extend the utility so that it contains the complete functionality requested by the customer at this phase of the project. In this sprint we will pick all of the current requirements from the product backlog as all of the underlying functionality needed for them are already in place from the previous sprints. This means that we will also aim to create a draft of the final design of the system during the sprint.

The most important function that is going to be implemented in this sprint is being able to display packets from different originating platforms properly. This will be implemented by having every packet contain a flag specifying a their originating platforms, and by having our dissectors use this flag value to influence how it handles the data in the packet.
