\subsection{Goals And Team Building}
%----------------------------------
The project started out with randomly assigned student groups of six to seven people. This was done intentionally to learn the students to work in a realistic setting. Our group consisted of six Norwegian students and one Czech student. 

As one of the team members was a foreign student, all the internal team communication had to be done in english. In addition our advisors were english speaking, so the whole project was done in english. This did not occur as a problem, because all the team members both spoke and wrote fluent english.

At the first meeting we decided to state our personal goals for the project. This resulted in the following list:
\begin{itemize}
\item zfdfsds
\item sdfsfsdf
\end{itemize}


The shift from group to team came as a result of the team building we had in the start.
