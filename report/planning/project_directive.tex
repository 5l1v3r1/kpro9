\chapter{Project Directive}
%==================


\section{Project Mandate}
%--------------------------------
The purpose of this project was to develop a tool that automatically created Lua-dissectors for Wireshark, from C-header files. This report shows the teamâ€™s process from the initial requirement specification to the finished product. 
\\
The name of the project is: Wireshark - Automated generation of protocol dissectors

\section{The Client}
%----------------------------
The client for this project is Thales Norway AS. Thales is an international electronics and systems group. The Norwegian branch primarily supplies military communication systems, for use by the Norwegian Armed Forces and other NATO countries.

\section{Project Background}
%----------------------------
The background for this project was that Thales wanted to extend the functionality of Wireshark, so that they could use it monitor internal data in processes. The extended functionality was automatic generation of Lua-dissectors from C-header files. The utility had to be configurable and extendable.

\section{Project Objective}
%------------------------------
 The objective of this project was to design a utility that should be able to generate Lua code for dissecting the binary representation of C/C++ structs, allowing Wireshark to show, filter, and search through such data.

\section{Duration}
%--------------------------------
Calculations done by the course staff suggests that each student should use 325 person-hours distributed over 13 weeks. Our group, consisting of seven students, will have a total of 2275 person-hours to spend on the project.\\
\\- Project start: August 30th
