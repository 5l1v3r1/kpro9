\chapter{Test Plan}
%==================
This chapter presents the test plan for our solution. The test plan is based on
the standards set by the IEEE829-1998 standard for software testing, but with a
few changes to better fit with our project. The purpose of this plan is to have
a structured way of preforming tests, as well as providing the developers with
a list of specific component-behaviors.The tests will be based on functional as
well as non functional requirements, deterring architectural drift and
enforcing our design plans for the system.

\section{Templates for testing}
%------------------------------
\autoref{tab:testcase} and \autoref{tab:testreport} are templates we'll be
using for testing purposes.

\begin{table}[ht] \small \center
\caption{Test case template \label{tab:testcase}}
\begin{tabular}{l l}
	\toprule
	Portion & Description \\
	\midrule
	Description & Description of requirement \\
	Tester & Team member responsible for the test \\
	Prerequisites & Conditions that needs to be fulfilled before starting the test \\
