This is a list of configuration needed to test the provided Lua
scripts with the attached capture file.

* Start Wireshark and locate the preferences directory: "Help -> About
  -> Folders -> Personal configuration".  On a UN*X based system this is
  ~/.wireshark/
* Copy 1-luastructs.lua to ~/.wireshark/
* Copy the rest of the lua scripts to ~/.wireshark/plugins/ (create
  the directory if it does not exist)
* Edit ~/.wireshark/init.lua (create the file if it does not exist)
  and insert the following code:  dofile("1-luastructs.lua")
  This is because we have to ensure 1-luastructs.lua is loaded before
  all other Lua scripts.
* (re)Start Wireshark. The loaded scripts (from the plugins directory)
  should be listed in Help -> About -> Plugins
* Open "Edit -> Preferences -> Protocols -> DLT_USER -> Encapsulations
  Table".  Add an entry with DLT=147 and Payload protocol=luastructs.
  This is because we have captured packets using a generic
  user-defined DLT (data link type)
* Open the attached luastructs-example.pcap and observe that this is
  dissected as previously shown at meetings.

Once you have configured this the only needed changes would be to add
new scripts to ~/.wireshark/plugins/

The Wireshark Lua support is documented here:
