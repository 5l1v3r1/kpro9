\chapter{Test Plan}

This chapter presents the test plan for our solution. The test plan is based on  the standards set by the IEEE829-1998 standard for software testing, but with a few changes to better fit with our project. The purpose of this plan is to have a structured way of preforming tests, as well as providing the developers with a list of specific component-behaviors.The tests will be based on functional as well as non functional requirements, deterring architectural drift and enforcing our design plans for the system.

\section{Templates for testing}

Here we will present the different templates we'll be using for testing purposes\\
