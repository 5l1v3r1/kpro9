#. **pycpaser** 
    `Pycparser <http://code.google.com/p/pycparser/>`_ is a C parser (and AST generator) implemented in Python. Due to the continuous development, CSjark requires the latest development version (not the release version).

    ========================== ===   

#. **pyYAML** 
    
    `pyYAML <http://pyyaml.org/wiki/PyYAML>`_ is a YAML parser and emitter for the Python programming language. `YAML <http://yaml.org/>`_ is a standard used to specify configurations to CSjark. The website includes both a way to download the software and also instructions of how to install it.
