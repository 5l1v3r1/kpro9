Here's a set of include files consisting of the special cases
I and Stig were able to conjure over a couple of days. The list
may not be exhaustive, but should cover most situations.

The code has been written with spaghetti in mind, with various
defines and include scenarios which should challenge your parser.

We've made sure the header files compile on
Linux, MacOS X, Win32 (vs2008) and Solaris, but we haven't much more
testing than that -- so there might be errors.

test.c - Initializes /part/ of the xcon struct.
xcon.h - header file containing the main xcon struct.

Special case to be noted:

sap.h:
SAP s_port: Should be displayed as a short, not as two chars.
