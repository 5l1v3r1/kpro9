Development rules
=====================

This document describes coding requirements and conventions for working with the CSjark code base. Please read it carefully and ask back any questions you might have.

Coding Style Standard
---------------------

The programming language used to implement the utility is Python. All the code should as much as possible follow the coding style described in the Style Guide for Python Code (PEP8_). In addition we decided that the design should attempt to be pythonic, as detailed by PEP20_.

.. _PEP8: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
.. _PEP20: http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/


Code base
----------

The entire CSjark project is hosted on `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_. In order to get the source code, you can:

- clone the Git repository: https://github.com/eventh/kpro9
- `download most recent tar archive <https://github.com/eventh/kpro9/zipball/master>`_
- `download most recent zip archive <https://github.com/eventh/kpro9/tarball/master>`_

.. note:: When commiting to the repository, always write good log messages. It will help people that will read the diffs in the future.

Issue tracking
--------------

For issue tracking, we use bug tracking capabilities of GitHub. You can register bugs, discuss issues or see whatâ€™s going on for the next milestone, both from an email and from a web interface.
