\begin{abstract}
This report presents the work done in a project on behalf of 
Thales Norway AS, for the course TDT4290 Customer Driven Project in 
collaboration with NTNU.

The project members consisted of seven students from the Norwegian University 
of Technology and Science.

The task was to develop a tool for Wireshark that could automatically
dissect C-structs. The Wireshark dissectors was implemented in Lua scripts, 
which our utility created. The tool itself was written in Python. In addition 
to this the tool supports configuration-files written in YAML.

During the development process we used the Scrum methodology for
management. 

The project duration was from the 30th August to the 24th of November.
